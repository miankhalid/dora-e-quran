This is a work in progress and is an effort to learn the Holy Quran by listening to a reputable aalim in the field of Quranic Studies i.e. Dr. Israr Ahmad.

There might be mistakes in the notes or my interpretation of what Dr. Israr said in his words. For that I am sorry and always looking to improve and fix those mistakes.
